# Soccer Predictor
This program uses the Sklearn RandomForestClassifier to create a machine learning program to predict soccer matches. I begin by cleaning the data to be used in machine learning by getting rid of unnecessary columns, replacing necessary non-numerical data with numbers, and getting rid of null values. I then initialize a SequentialFeatureSelector model with a RandomForestClassifier to find the columns that best predict match outcomes. From there I implement a function called backtest to make predictions by feeding the RandomForestClassifier the found predictor columns. Finally, I use the Sklearn accuracy score function to evaluate the accuracy of the model, which was .6721.
